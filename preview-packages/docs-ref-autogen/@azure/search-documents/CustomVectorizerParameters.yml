      Applies to custom endpoints that connect to external code in an Azure
      function or some other application that provides the transformations. This
      value should be the application ID created for the function or app when it
      was registered with Azure Active Directory. When specified, the
      vectorization connects to the function or app using a managed ID (either
      system or user-assigned) of the search service and the access token of the
      function or app, using this value as the resource id for creating the
      scope of the access token.
